# HTTP-status-codes-details
HTTP status codes are standard responses given by web servers when a request is made to them. They indicate whether the request was successful, if there was an error, or if additional actions are needed. Here's a detailed breakdown of the categories and specific codes:

---

### **1xx Informational Responses**
These indicate that the server has received the request and is processing it.

- **100 Continue:** The client can continue with its request after receiving this interim response.
- **101 Switching Protocols:** The server is switching protocols as requested by the client (e.g., from HTTP to WebSocket).

---

### **2xx Success**
These indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.

- **200 OK:** The request was successful, and the server returned the requested data.
- **201 Created:** The request was successful, and a new resource was created (commonly used in POST requests).
- **202 Accepted:** The request has been accepted for processing but is not yet completed.
- **204 No Content:** The request was successful, but the server is not returning any content.

---

### **3xx Redirection**
These indicate that further action is needed to complete the request.

- **301 Moved Permanently:** The resource has been moved to a new URL permanently.
- **302 Found:** The resource is temporarily located at a different URL.
- **304 Not Modified:** The resource has not been modified since the last request; the client can use its cached version.

---

### **4xx Client Errors**
These indicate issues caused by the client, such as a bad request or unauthorized access.

- **400 Bad Request:** The server cannot process the request due to a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax).
- **401 Unauthorized:** Authentication is required but not provided or invalid.
- **403 Forbidden:** The client does not have permission to access the resource.
- **404 Not Found:** The server cannot find the requested resource.
- **429 Too Many Requests:** The client has sent too many requests in a given time period (rate-limiting).

---

### **5xx Server Errors**
These indicate issues on the serverâ€™s side that prevent it from fulfilling the request.

- **500 Internal Server Error:** The server encountered an unexpected error.
- **502 Bad Gateway:** The server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
- **503 Service Unavailable:** The server is temporarily unavailable (overloaded or under maintenance).
- **504 Gateway Timeout:** The server did not receive a timely response from an upstream server.

Bypassing HTTP status codes typically means addressing the issue causing the response. Here's how to handle and resolve the most common HTTP status codes that might require action:

---

### **1xx Informational Responses**
- No bypass needed; these codes are temporary and indicate the server is processing your request.

---

### **2xx Success**
- These codes indicate the request was successful, so no bypass is needed.

---

### **3xx Redirection (e.g., 301, 302)**
To bypass redirections:
1. **Follow the Redirect:** Most browsers and HTTP clients automatically follow redirects. Ensure your client (e.g., cURL, Python requests) is configured to do so.
   - Example with `cURL`: Use `-L` to follow redirects.
2. **Direct Access:** If you know the new location, access it directly.
3. **Avoid Redirect Loops:** Inspect the redirection chain using debugging tools like cURL or browser dev tools to identify and fix loops.

---

### **4xx Client Errors (e.g., 401, 403, 404)**
- **401 Unauthorized:**
  1. Provide correct authentication credentials (username, password, or API token).
  2. Use a proxy or VPN if access is restricted by location.
  3. Contact the server administrator if you're supposed to have access.

- **403 Forbidden:**
  1. Check for permission issues on the resource.
  2. Use a VPN or proxy if your IP is blocked.
  3. Verify user-agent headers if the server blocks certain clients.
  4. Look for access tokens or referral headers required to access the resource.

- **404 Not Found:**
  1. Double-check the URL for typos.
  2. Search for the content on the site using its search bar.
  3. Use an archive tool like [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org) to find the resource if it has been moved or deleted.

- **429 Too Many Requests:**
  1. Wait before sending more requests.
  2. Use rate-limiting techniques in your scripts or tools.
  3. Switch to a different IP using a proxy or VPN.

---

### **5xx Server Errors (e.g., 500, 502, 503, 504)**
- **500 Internal Server Error:**
  1. Report the issue to the website administrator.
  2. Retry the request later.

- **502 Bad Gateway:**
  1. Check your connection and retry the request.
  2. Use a VPN to connect through a different route.
  3. If you're the server admin, check your upstream server configuration.

- **503 Service Unavailable:**
  1. Wait until the server becomes available.
  2. Retry periodically.

- **504 Gateway Timeout:**
  1. Try a different network or a VPN to reroute traffic.
  2. If you're the admin, optimize server performance or check upstream connections.

### **Tools to Help Bypass or Debug**
1. **Browser Developer Tools:**
   - Inspect responses and headers.
2. **cURL or Postman:**
   - Debug API responses and test different request parameters.
3. **Proxies or VPNs:**
   - Bypass geographical or IP-based restrictions.
4. **Automation Scripts:**
   - Use Python, JavaScript, or other tools to handle redirects, retries, or header modifications.
